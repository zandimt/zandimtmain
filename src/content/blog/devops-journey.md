as a newbie in the full-stack world, every article i read or every person i spoke to highlighted for me that devops is now a big part of what
it means to be a developer. while in previous years devops had a more concrete role, i believe that with the current market, where companies prefer people that can cover multiple roles at once,
i figured it's pretty important to integrate it within my current skillset, as it gives me more leverage when applying for jobs
or showcasing my interests.

## the beginning

i started my devops journey this summer with the goal of getting a solid understanding of the foundations in order to apply them to my current projects
and future ones. i started with basic cloud computing concepts for the time being through AWS' skill builder platform, which is a great resource for
learning the foundations. besides that, i'd been dabbling with docker here and there in previous projects, and while i understood what it did, i never
approached it in a structures way, so my Dockerfiles would look like a mess and i'd have no idea how to optimize them.

## the plan

the plan is to continue with the AWS skill builder platform, at least purely for the free courses which i believe are still a strong start. otherwise, i have a couple
of udemy courses which i purchased last summer and i never got around to finishing them, so i'll be going through them while building my projects.

now, while it's not part of my main role, i'm looking to integrate devops practices in my current internship with ccdiagnostics in order to optimise
the platform we are working on. i'm looking to use docker to containerise the app, and then i'll see further on which AWS services i can use to deploy it easier.

i'll be documenting my progress here, so stay tuned for more updates on my devops journey!
